<a name="instalasi"></a>
## Instalasi

Halondry beberapa package pada [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) sebagai dependencies manager, pastikan composer telah terinstall.

Pertama, ketikan perintah ini pada terminal (harus sudah masuk pada direktori aplikasi):

    composer install

Make sure to place the `$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin` directory (or the equivalent directory for your OS) in your $PATH so the `antvel` executable can be located by your system.

Once installed, the `antvel install` command will create a fresh copy of the project in the directory you provided. For example, `antvel install` will create a directory named `App-master` containing a fresh Antvel installation with all of its dependencies already installed:

    antvel install

## Dashboard

Here, you will be able to manage the base information of your store, such as categories, products features and more.

At the moment, the panel just has the module to manage the store categories, products and products features. However, it is intended to be the replacement for ***wpanel***.

You will be able to visit this section by typing this address within your installed app, as so ```http://app.dev/dashboard```. Once the whole ***wpanel*** is migrated to it, we will be updating the references in the app. Remember, you will have to be logged in either as seller or admin.
